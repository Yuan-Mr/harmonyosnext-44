✨ Hidden HarmonyOS Development Cases Revealed! Step-by-Step Guide to Application Continuation ✨

Hello everyone! Today I want to share an incredibly practical HarmonyOS development technique! I always felt that HarmonyOS official documentation examples were too deeply hidden, but recently I accidentally discovered treasure code related to "application continuation" and couldn't help but organize it into valuable content overnight! This article will use the most straightforward language + tons of examples to help everyone easily achieve the magical effect of "switching from phone to tablet without losing progress"! 🚀

🌟 Why Use Application Continuation?
Imagine these scenarios 👇:
● 📱 Scrolling through Taobao for half an hour on your phone, then switching to tablet and having to scroll from the beginning again... (Frustrating!)
● 🎬 Watching a movie halfway through, switching devices to continue, but the progress bar resets to zero... (Maddening!)
● 📖 Reading a webpage for 20 screens, switching devices, only to have to find your position again... (Suffocating!)
HarmonyOS's distributed capabilities are here to save you! Today we'll focus on conquering three high-frequency scenarios: long lists, media playback, and web browsing continuation features, complete with full code and troubleshooting guides!

🛠️ Environment Setup
First, make sure your project configuration is correct!
1. Enable continuation capability in module.json5 (Required!)
{
  "module": {
    "abilities": [
      {
        "continuable": true  // This line must be added!
      }
    ]
  }
}
2. Permission application: Add distributed permissions in config.json:
"reqPermissions": [
  {
    "name": "ohos.permission.DISTRIBUTED_DATASYNC"
  }
]

📜 Scenario 1: Long List Continuation (e.g., Shopping Cart List)
Pain point: Scrolled to item 100, switch devices and have to start from the beginning again?
🔑 Core Code
// 1. Monitor scroll position
Scroll(this.scroller) {
  // ...list content
}
.onDidScroll((xOffset, yOffset) => {
  // Record current y-axis scroll position
  AppStorage.setOrCreate('currentOffset', yOffset);
})

// 2. Source device saves data
async onContinue(wantParam) {
  const currentOffset = AppStorage.get('currentOffset') || 0;
  const dataObject = distributedDataObject.create(this.context, { currentOffset });
  const sessionId = distributedDataObject.genSessionId();
  dataObject.setSessionId(sessionId);
  wantParam.distributedSessionId = sessionId;
  dataObject.save(wantParam.targetDevice);
  return AbilityConstant.OnContinueResult.AGREE;
}

// 3. Target device restores data
continueRestore(want) {
  const sessionId = want.parameters.distributedSessionId;
  const dataObject = distributedDataObject.create(this.context, {});
  dataObject.setSessionId(sessionId);
  
  dataObject.on('status', (sessionId, networkId, status) => {
    if (status === 'restored') {
      // Get the previous scroll position
      const savedOffset = dataObject['currentOffset'];
      this.scroller.scrollTo({ xOffset:0, yOffset:savedOffset });
    }
  });
}
Troubleshooting Guide:
● List components must be wrapped with Scroll, directly manipulating List scrolling may fail!
● If the list has pagination loading, remember to pass page number parameters as well!

🎥 Scenario 2: Video Playback Continuation (e.g., Bilibili device switching)
Pain point: Watching at 45 minutes, switch devices, progress bar returns to the beginning?
🔑 Core Code
// 1. Monitor playback progress
this.avPlayer.on('timeUpdate', (currentTime) => {
  AppStorage.setOrCreate('videoProgress', currentTime);
});

// 2. Save progress (inside onContinue method)
const progress = AppStorage.get('videoProgress') || 0;
const dataObject = distributedDataObject.create(this.context, { progress });

// 3. Restore playback
// Note! Must execute seek after video is loaded
this.avPlayer.on('stateChange', (state) => {
  if (state === 'playing') {
    const savedTime = dataObject['progress'];
    this.avPlayer.seek(savedTime); // Jump to recorded time
  }
});
Troubleshooting Guide:
● Must wait for video to enter playing state before calling seek, otherwise it's无效!
● If it's an online video, ensure the target device has the same playback permissions!

🌐 Scenario 3: Web Browsing Continuation (e.g., Zhihu long articles)
Pain point: Reading a webpage for 20 screens, switch devices and return to the top?
🔑 Core Code
// 1. Monitor webpage scrolling
Web({ controller: this.webController })
.onTouch((event) => {
  if (event.type === TouchType.Up) {
    // Get current scroll position
    this.webController.runJavaScript('window.pageYOffset').then((result) => {
      AppStorage.setOrCreate('webScrollY', result);
    });
  }
})

// 2. Save data (inside onContinue method)
const scrollY = AppStorage.get('webScrollY') || 0;
const dataObject = distributedDataObject.create(this.context, { scrollY });

// 3. Restore scroll position
onPageEnd(() => {
  const savedY = dataObject['scrollY'];
  this.webController.runJavaScript(`window.scrollTo(0, ${savedY})`);
})
Troubleshooting Guide:
● Some webpages use document.documentElement.scrollTop instead of window.pageYOffset
● If the webpage has dynamically loaded content, consider using element ID for precise positioning!

💡 Development Tips
1. Debugging tool: Use hilog to print distributed data transfer logs:
hilog.info(0x0000, 'DEBUG', 'Current progress: %{public}s', savedOffset);
2. Compatibility handling: Older devices may not support continuation, remember to add try-catch!
3. Data compression: If passing large objects, compress with zlib first to reduce transmission time!

🚀 Summary
Master these three scenarios and your App instantly gains the superpower of "smooth switching"! Actually, HarmonyOS distributed development goes far beyond these—cross-device clipboard, shared camera, and other features are also super interesting! If everyone encounters problems, feel free to shout out on the Huawei Developer Community, many experts are online answering questions!
Final soul-searching question: What other "switching interruption" scenarios have you encountered that made you want to smash your phone? Let's vent together in the comments, maybe the next issue will have solutions! 💥
